## âœ¨ Principles we follow âœ¨

### ðŸ¤–<->ðŸ§‘ Robot-human interaction

Some tasks are better suited for automation or artificial intelligence, while others are better handled by humans. Robots excel at performing quick calculations and executing movements with precision, but human experience can transcend the predefined models within a robot. In such cases, human intervention can enhance the robot's effectiveness. Therefore, when designing our robots, we consider seamless interaction between the robot and humans, not only in emergencies or during robot training but also during regular, routine robot operations.

### ðŸ§  Robot AI

Robotics has the potential to tackle tasks that humans cannot manage. Thanks to computational methods, neural networks, and other tools collectively referred to as 'robot intelligence,' the power of robotics can grow infinitely. Autonomous ocean exploration, mineral extraction, and surgical procedures can become significantly more efficient if robots are granted the ability to independently assess situations and make decisions, rather than merely adhering to a strict set of predefined rules and human instructions.

### ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤– Robot-to-Robot interaction and big data

The operations of robots and the way the surrounding environment responds to them should be monitored and controlled by humans. Some tasks, for their effective execution, may require the collaborative and simultaneous efforts of thousands of robots. For example, if a robot is used to simulate a human organ (as in 'organ-on-a-chip' technology), an efficient drug testing network may involve thousands of artificial organisms, each receiving a specific drug dosage, and each organism representing a system of multiple 'organs-on-chip'.

### ðŸ“š Spread the knowledge

Once a discovery is made, it may take centuries before the necessary expertise is assembled to effectively utilize it. Almost two thousand years have passed since Aristotle proved that the Earth is round, and Eratosthenes calculated its dimensions, long before Columbus applied this knowledge. Many pieces of knowledge are only accessible to a select group of specialists, lying dormant until someone capable of putting them into practice discovers them. In our eyes, this knowledge represents the greatest value for humanity, and we treasure every opportunity to engage with its bearers. We believe that our knowledge in the field of robot control can be applied in diverse fields, from nuclear physics to healthcare, and we would be delighted to connect with experts in these domains.
